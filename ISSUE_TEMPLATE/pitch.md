## Rabbit Holes
List of the pitfalls already identified. Offer as many as are required to de-risk the project.

- Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
- Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
- Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
